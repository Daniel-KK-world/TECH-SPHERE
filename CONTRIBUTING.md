# 🤝 Contributing to Tech Sphere Community Projects Playground

Thank you for showing interest in contributing! This repo is built **by the community, for the community** and that includes YOU.

There are **two major ways** to contribute:

1. ✍️ Non-Code: Explaining programming concepts in your own words.
2. 🧑🏾‍💻 Code: Building beginner-friendly projects.

Let’s break it down!

## 🔧 Code Contributions

### 📍 Step 1: Fork & Clone

- Hit that **Fork** button at the top right.
- Clone the repo to your machine:
  ```bash
  git clone https://github.com/your-username/community-projects.git
  📍 Step 2: Choose Your Tier
  Navigate to the right folder:
  ```

tier-1-baby-steps/ for super simple projects

tier-2-logic-builders/ for logic-based stuff

tier-3-mini-apps/ and up for real-world stuff

Create a folder for your project:

tier-2-logic-builders/
├── rock-paper-scissors/
│ └── rps.py ← your code file
Use the code-template if you're not sure how to format things.

📍 Step 3: Create a Pull Request
Once you’re done:

git add .
git commit -m "Added Rock-Paper-Scissors game to tier-2"
git push
Then create a Pull Request (PR) from GitHub.

🧠 Non-Code Contributions (Explainers)
We welcome contributions that explain basic programming ideas in a fun, relatable way!

📍 Step 1: Go to explainers-non-code/
Choose the right section, like:

A-basics/ for variables, data types, etc.

B-control-flow/ for if/else, loops

... and so on.

Create a .md file like:

explainers-non-code/
├── A-basics/
│ └── variables.md
Your goal is to explain it in your own words. Use Naija-style analogies if it helps others get it. Use the explainer-template to guide you.

📍 Step 2: Submit Your PR
Same as with code:

git add .
git commit -m "Added explanation for variables"
git push
Then open a Pull Request. Easy!

🧪 Before You Submit...
✅ Run your code and test it.

✅ Use beginner-friendly variable names.

✅ Keep explanations clear and simple.

✅ Add comments in code to explain what’s going on.

🙏 House Rules
Be respectful.

No plagiarism.

Encourage and support others in Issues & PRs.
